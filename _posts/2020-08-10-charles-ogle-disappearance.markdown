**The Disappearance**


**Charles Ogle** was a businessman and developer in San Francisco and Oakland, California.  He disappeared on August 12, 1964, after he took off from Oakland International Airport in his Cessna 210A.


He left no flight plan.


For decades, his family did not know where he was heading.  In 1985, his son William located a woman seen with his father that turned out to be his pregnant mistress.  Charles told her he was heading to Reno, Nevada for business.  He invited her along but she declined.


However, wikipedia states that a private investigator hired by Charle's father determined he was actually heading to Las Vegas.


Charles Ogle’s sister Marian Brumett said there were theories that Charles had left his life for a new one, but said “My father knew if he was still alive, Chazzie would have contacted him. They were so close."



**Unidentified Crash Sites**


**Steve Fossett** was a “millionaire businessman” famous for his world records and adventures in balloons, sailboats, gliders, and powered aircraft.


Fossett disappeared on September 3, 2007 after taking off from a private airstrip near Smith Valley, Nevada in a Champion Super Decathlon.  The search for his crash site **revealed eight other crash sites**.


(The search for Steve Fossett was a failure.  His remains and aircraft weren’t found until a year later when a hiker discovered Fossett’s identification in the Inyo National Forest.)


However, according to wikipedia, only one of the crashed aircraft was “partially identified” and that Charles Ogle remains missing.


**Note**: I tried to Google if any of these eight crash sites have since been identified (and also asked in r/Aviation) but found nothing.




**Questions**


What happened to Charles Ogle?


Where was he headed?


Did he really crash over the Sierra Nevadas?  Maybe he crashed over San Francisco Bay or the Pacific?


Have the eight other crash sites been identified?  If *no*, then why haven't they?


Could one of the crash sites be Charles Ogles?


Who else is missing over the Sierra Nevadas?
