**Summary**

The Forgotten Winchester is a Model 1873 Winchester rifle that was found in 2014 by archaeologist Eva Jensen lying against a juniper tree in Great Basin National Park, Nevada.

The gun is over 100 years old but it's unknown how long it lay forgotten.

The park had instituted a “fuels reduction” project to help prevent wildfires.  As part of the project, the park sent members of their cultural resources office to search for any artifacts that may have been in the area.

Archaeologists searched the area for additional clues but found nothing (including no body).

The gun was sent to Buffalo Bill Center of the West in Cody, Wyoming for analysis and preservation.

To determine if the gun was loaded, a “wooden dowel” test was performed on the gun.  This involves inserting a wooden dowel down the barrel and measuring the length of the barrel to the breach.  A discrepancy in the lengths would indicate something in the barrel, possible a cartridge.

Since a discrepancy was found, the gun was taken to the local hospital to be X-rayed and checked in under the patient name “Rifle.”  The X-ray revealed that the rifle was not loaded.

However, it was discovered that the stock did contain a live .44-Winchester centerfire caliber cartridge.


**How long did the Winchester lay forgotten?**

The serial number from this Winchester indicates it was manufactured in 1882.  The cartridge found in the stock was manufactured between 1887 and 1911.  But these don’t pinpoint how long it was there.

The rifle was found upright against the juniper tree with the stock buried in 4- to 5-inches of natural debris.  I expected to find an estimate of how long it would take to accumulate this amount of debris, but haven’t been able to find anything.

The Fox News article (below in links) states that there was no recorded fire in the area which could have been used to date the gun’s presence at the tree.


*How long do you think the gun it was there?*

*Why do you think it was abandoned?*
